This game is in work in progress. I don't have much time to work on it; this is a beta test version. 
I'm aiming to continue between the end of 2024 and 2025 to develop a more complete version, with more enemies and enhanced actions for Magic and items. 
Feel free to use it however you like, and don't hesitate to share your customizations with me. ;)

-----------------------------------UPDATE 09th of January 2025-----------------------------------

To kick off the new year, I'm resuming the C.B.G and doing a complete overhaul. I'll update the new script and its dependencies at the end. I might even create another repository for the occasion.
